      'The series revolves around several people whose story is revealed during the course of the series. As you can see, the name of the series does not reflect the essence of the second. Since it is not only about the robbery of a paper house, in addition to this, a bunch of storylines are told, many digressions, and what to hide in the future, it ends up not only with the robbery of just one paper house. I was very impressed by the series, indeed I managed to experience many feelings, such as feelings, anxiety, joy and sadness, and so on. I consider the series completed to its end point, which is a pity, since there are only a few such series in terms of quality. Very well thought out and brought to a clear end. It is my recommendation for viewing for any taste of the beholder.',

      'This is the series about which I can safely say that it develops quickly. I really like it when already from the first series there is some kind of interesting plot, as happens in this series. The series itself is tied to a mystic that takes place in a small town called Hawkins. A group of guys is trying to save the city and their friends from the monsters that hide in the secret world and in the course of their investigations they find an indispensable girlfriend, El, who has very strong telepathic abilities, which helps the guys fight this evil. Although the series begins with the age of the main characters about 12 years old, viewers of any age will like it. It is very saturated with the culture and aesthetics of the times in which the series is located, there are a lot of Easter eggs, in almost every series. I definitely recommend this series to all my friends, even convincing me that this is not a logical series, my friends changed their minds after watching, but watched all the seasons in just a few days. Such is this Hawkinsg, addictive!',

      'The series is a complete contradiction of a quick start. The development of events takes a very long time, the director prepares us for a long story of a simple teacher who is deep in debt and needs even more money. The series is very tied to the relationship between people and not only love. A very difficult story of a family from a small town in the USA. The first two or three seasons do not look very enthusiastic, but after that the series gains momentum and becomes one of the best thrillers and even action movies. I can’t recommend the series to absolutely everyone, although it is really very cool, but its long acceleration of events made me think several times about continuing to watch. Only after the end of all seasons was it clear why this was done. The director wanted to immerse the viewer in the life of an ordinary person, which was turned upside down.',

      'The series literally speaks for itself with its name. Yes, there is not a straight almanac on sex education. It is about how teenagers decided to create a club to help schoolchildren in matters of sexual education. Also in the series there are many storylines tied to the teenagers who created this club and their friends. The series is filled with the atmosphere of the United States, like many others that are recorded in the United States. But this one is just as memorable. The relationship between the creators of the parenting club is also shown very well, as the relationship between Otis and Jean went from nothing to an almost serious relationship. I was impressed by this series, which I recommend watching, especially for fans of the Netflix series, it is very well filmed and quite funny.',

At first, I confess that I watched only one episode and stopped talking about the series as an amateur. But after a couple of years, I again decided to try to start watching the series. 4 seasons were watched in just a week or two. Really very cool series that you want to forget and watch again. What is the story of the person of the protagonist - Thomas Shelby and his titanic work for his company and family. What captures in the moment the series with its unexpected endings and exciting moments that occur while watching. I always advise everyone this series, it is suitable for everyone, a solid 10.',

      'This series tells us about the nightlife of a wealthy nightclub owner who previously dealt drugs in large quantities and is trying to get out of this business. But he constantly gets spokes in the wheels and cannot do it calmly. At the same moment, a girl appears who was the love of life in his childhood, but because of their studies, they were forced to stop communicating. In the future, this leads to the collapse of his family life and leaves a stain not only on him, but also on his children and business. They also show us the whole dark life of New York from the inside, how money is laundered and how drug empires are built. Really well filmed, good plot, it is very captivating and you want to constantly watch it again and again. I recommend watching it after all those series that are on this site marked 10.',

      'Quite a funny series about students in an elite school. In which murders constantly occur, in which almost everyone in this school can be involved. The series revolves around Samuel, a guy from a poor family who, by a lucky chance, managed to get into this school, as well as about his inner circle. I will call this series interesting and captivating, but still there are cooler works, the same Paper House, which is also filmed in Spain, like this series. The series will be of interest to the younger generation, the older one is rather poor and clumsy, perhaps. The show does not get my nomination for any type recommendation awards, but it is still a good show, but really not for everyone.',

      'To be honest, this series was found by me by accident, I watched the first season, at that time there was only one. And it seemed like nonsense to me. The series is about a house that had keys, which in turn gave abilities, for example: teleportation, penetration into the mind, invisibility, and so on. Also in the series there is a dark force locked in a dungeon, but by chance the main character, without knowing it, releases this monster into the wild and then he and his friends try to prevent this evil. The series did not impress me, I will not say that I was interested in watching it directly, it was like having nothing to do to watch it. I will not watch the next seasons and cannot recommend it to you either. This, in my opinion, is not an amateur series, but in general a poorly thought out plot, not correctly filmed, not exciting. In general, this series receives a well-deserved assessment from me and is in the red zone.',

This is what he earns by working for the state and helping to deal with the robbers, as well as performing manipulations with people for a lot of money. During the series, the protagonist meets a detective who he really likes and they start a love relationship, but at first it’s just work. This work, although from Russian directors, deserves attention. I won’t say that the shooting here is cool, but an interesting plot and characters, in general, this series has changed my opinion a little about the approach in the countries of the former CIS, but still there are some shortcomings in this series to get 10 points from me.',

      'The series is about difficult teenagers, which is clear from the title. Teenagers from completely different families, both in terms of financial level and relationships within. Teenagers go to the correctional center, which replaces their school, but this center hires a new physical education teacher, who in the past was the best football player in the country, and because of his past in which he was in prison, he decides to whitewash his name, since no one wanted to collaborate with him on a professional level. He opens a football team in this center, before his arrival there was no talk of sports there, and leads the team to success. At the same time, he runs into a lot of problems, such as the players have constant problems, then fights, then drinking. He also develops feelings for a teacher he doesn’t go with, all of which anchors the storylines of the teenagers themselves. Although the series is from Russian directors, it seemed interesting to me, although, as always, the shooting is not perfect and at the moment it looks very ridiculous. The series does not receive my recommendations, but it is really quite good, especially if there is nothing to watch.',
